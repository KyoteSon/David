                    I learned Rhino for the first time in the Digital Crafting Basic class I took last winter semester.
                    <br>

                    This ring was the first work I've ever made with Rhino.
                    At first, it was a ring inspired by the Korean and American flags.
                    <br>
                    For this project, I wanted to make my own ring.
                    To that end, I made my logo and designed it on the ring.
                    <br>
                    It was difficult to try casting for the first time, but it was a really fun and interesting experience.
