                  While looking at the things I'm going to redesign at my house,
                   I found an object that I always felt uncomfortable using. 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   As soon as we come out of the shower, we should remove the moisture with a towel.
                    Otherwise, we can catch a cold.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                     So most toilets have towels next to shower facilities.
                      There is a towel rack right next to the shower booth at my house, and I felt a lot of inconvenience using it.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The reason is that I need enough space to hang a towel, but the towel rack in my house is designed very small.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      So not only is it hard to hang a towel, but even if I hang a towel hardly, it falls easily.
                      So I'm going to design this towel rack as a more practical towel rack. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The design draft I'm currently thinking of is making a towel rack that combines both practicality and design. 
                      Since the wall with the towel rack attached to my bathroom is narrow, I will use this space to make a practical towel rack. 
                      It will be designed so that clothes or shower gowns can be hung, not just one towel hanger
