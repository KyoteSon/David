                        I’m an international student from South Korea studying interaction design at School of the Art Insitute of Chicago (SAIC). I want to be a designer who can actually express what I imagine, not thinking of a stereotypical design. When I walk through the streets where I have traveled, most buildings and crosswalks have similar structures. The buildings are rectangular and the crosswalks have been designed with black color and white dashed lines.

                         In my perspective, they don’t necessarily need to be designed like that. I always wonder when I see formal designs in general. The buildings can be decorated using a variety of geometrical shapes rather than rectangular cubes. Instead of using boring black and white, it will be more attractive when using color on the crosswalks.

                        Like this, I want to be a unique and creative designer, not create designs that people generally think of.

                        Before I studied at university, I did not understand the phrase "inspired". However, when I went to college and worked on art that I had to create myself, I thought I needed an element to be inspired. 
                        <br>
                        At first, I didn't know how to be inspired. So I researched through art books and saw many designs. However, the more I tried to be inspired, the more I could think of nothing. Meanwhile, when I was working on designing a smartphone application’s interface, I suddenly looked out the window while I was thinking about the color arrangement. The colorful Chicago buildings inspired me to create a new color pallet.

                        <strong> Everything in the real world is an inspiration.</strong>
